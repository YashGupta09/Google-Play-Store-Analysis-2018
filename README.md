# Google-Play-Store-Analysis-2018
1. A machine learning model to predict the performance of new apps yet to be deployed on app store, in terms of successful or not successful. Model predicts performance with an accuracy of 95%.
2. Have used one-hot encoding for 'Category' column which leads to a large number of columns. I am still working on it and looking for a different solution to deal with so many categories.
3. When 'Category' column dropped, achieved 96% accuracy. 
4. In this project, I realised that scaling the data improves accuracy by 10%.
5. Will add various visualizations in the notebook in future.
